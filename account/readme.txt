This is a simple login script that i created. You may redistrabute it 
and/or modify it to  your liking if you improve it in any way please 
drop me a email with  the modified code.

Installation:

1.Open up config.php in your favorite text editor like notepad and 
modify the database info and site info to meet your needs.
2.Upload all the files to your website with a ftp client like wsftp.
